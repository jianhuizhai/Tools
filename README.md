# Useful Tools

* debye_frequency.py is used to calculate debye frequency of materials. (Debye temperature should be known first)

* jogInteraction.py is used to calculate elastic interaction energy of a jog pair using anisotropic properties.

* coulomb_vs_elastic.py is used to compare the coulomb force and elastic interaction force.

* jogInteraction_isotropic.py is used to calculate elastic interaction energy of jog pair by using isotropic properties.

* rotation.py is used to rotate atoms along x axis by a specified degree. Details information see the code.

* deleteUselessFolderDumpfile.py is used to delete useless dumpfiles in seperate folders (useful in calculating point distribution energy)

* zeus2my.py is used to copy files in subfolders between hpc and my computer.

* zip_unzip.py is used to zip or zip files in folders v_mg and/or v_o (including subfolders in v_mg and/or v_o).
