# Useful Tools

* debye_frequency.py is used to calculate debye frequency of materials. (Debye temperature should be known first)

* jogInteraction.py is used to calculate elastic interaction energy of a jog pair using anisotropic properties.

* coulomb_vs_elastic.py is used to compare the coulomb force and elastic interaction force.

* jogInteraction_isotropic.py is used to calculate elastic interaction energy of jog pair by using isotropic properties.

* rotation.py is used to rotate atoms along x axis by a specified degree. Details information see the code.
